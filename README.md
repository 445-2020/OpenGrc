## About OpenGRC

OpenGRC is a cyber Governance, Risk, and Compliance web application intended for use by small businesses and teams. This is not intended to replace large-scale GRC Platforms, but it just might for your usecase. OpenGRC provides a resource for those who need to manage a security program but can't manage the price tag and complexity of alternatives.

- Simple interface designed to get up and running with very little training
- Quick imports of common security frameworks
- Ability to connect Standards, Controls, and your actual Implementations
- Ability to perform audits for internal and external assessments
- Report generation capability to create deliverables for auditors
- Intuitive dashboards to display your progress

Above all, OpenGRC is written to solve cyber compliance headaches that tend to be caused by complex enterprise solutions. It doesn't have to be that hard!
